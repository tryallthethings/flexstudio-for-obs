Flexstudio for OBS is an innovative, open-source utility that offers a seamless way to make OBS Studio fully portable. Developed using C#, this solution is compatible with .NET Framework 4.7 or higher and optimized for Windows 10 and 11. There is no extra installation / setup required and it doesn't leave anything behind. It's easy to use, requires no installation and has a modern user interface.

## üåü Features

- **Portability**: Flexstudio for OBS optimizes your portability by clever assignment a consistent (virtual) drive letter to your portable OBS Studio folder, regardless of the machine you're using. If you start the tool from a USB stick, Flexstudio for OBS ensures that OBS Studio always "sees" the same drive letter. This approach utilizes built-in Windows mechanisms, requiring no extra setup from the user, providing a hassle-free and portable experience. 
- **Version Management**: Flexstudio for OBS can maintain one local and multiple portable versions of OBS, download new versions, and backup existing ones.
- **Backup**: Safeguard your OBS profiles while maintaining the integrity of your settings.
- **Smart Management**: Flexstudio for OBS maintains an overview of the running OBS versions, ensuring each version is only started once. This tracking even persists when the tool itself is closed or restarted, offering a seamless user experience.
- **Automated Convenience**: Comes with an automation feature, which upon tool start, can automatically map the virtual drive and launch OBS. This functionality can be customized by the user's preference.

## üåç Multi-Language Support

Flexstudio for OBS currently supports English and German. We welcome contributions for adding support for other languages.

## üõë Limitations

- **Audio and video devices**: Audio and video devices such as soundcards and webcams are machine specific and you will always need to select them on the PC your are starting OBS on again.

## üé® Future Plans

- **Theming**: Customization options to give Flexstudio a personal touch.
- **Restore Functionality**: Restoring full OBS versions or specific profiles.
- **Auto-Updates**: Update existing OBS portable versions to the latest or any other version (choosable by the user).
- **Cloud Backup**: Offering backup/restore functionality to and from cloud services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, NextCloud, etc.
- **Drive Letter Modification**: Altering the drive letter for portable OBS versions in their respective config/profile if the assigned drive letter is already in use.

2. Place it in a folder of your choice (for example on an USB stick) and start it. ‚ùó *To keep things organized I recommend a new folder as the tool creates a few subfolders and a config file in the folder it's started from.* 
3. Go to the settings tab and select the virtual drive letter you want to use.
4. On the dashboard tab click map drive .
5. Download an OBS version on the OBS versions tab and click *Start*. This will start the OBS version on the virtual drive you selected. If you add media now (images, sounds, videos, etc.) to your OBS scenes, make sure you are selecting them on the virtual drive.
